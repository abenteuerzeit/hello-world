# Hello World Python Project

This project was created as part of the Fullstack 12-month weekend course at Codecool (<https://codecool.com/en/>).

This project is a series of exercises that demonstrate different aspects of the Python programming language, including printing to the console, defining and calling functions, using return values, getting user input, calling functions with arguments, and separating concerns.

## Files

The project includes the following files:

1. helloworld.py: This file contains a function that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. hellofunction.py: This file contains a function that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
3. helloreturn.py: This file contains two functions, one that returns the "Hello, World!" message and another that prints the message to the console.
4. helloinput.py: This file contains two functions, one that asks for the user's name and returns a custom greeting message, and another that prints the greeting message to the console.
5. helloargument.py: This file contains three functions, one that asks for the user's name and returns it in capitalized form, another that returns a greeting message using the user's name, and a third that prints the greeting message to the console after collecting the returned values from the other two functions.

## Running the Project

To run the project, navigate to the directory containing the project files and run the following command:
```console
python3 <filename>.py
```
Replace <filename> with the name of the file you want to run (e.g., helloworld.py, hellofunction.py, etc.).

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3 to be installed on your system. You can download Python 3 from the official website.
